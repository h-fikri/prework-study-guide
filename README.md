# Husain F Hidayah - Prework Study Guide edX Bootcamp

## Description
This project is an introductory level to the bootcamp to "touch base". 
While I have a beginner-level of HTML CSS and Javascript Coding, the real challenges is Git and Github, including the installation of SSH Keys. 

For the past week doing Pre Work, 80% of my study time went to Git, Github, Terminal, and Installation. At the end of the week, I feel 80% more confident in using basic Git Collaboration. Although I still need to learn a lot, like rebase, working with branches of branches of branches and how to merge them all, I believe I can finish them within another week. 

On the other hand, the material on HTML and CSS discussed in the first week of class, ending 21 October 2022, is fairly simple and I have been through them from my own personal knowledge after learning by myself previously.

Onward, I need to allocate my time through CSS layout practice like grid and flexbox, and mostly on Javascript. 

It's an uphill battle but nothing beats persistence.
